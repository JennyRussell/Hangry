# Hangry

Description

This application is like tinder but for finding restaurants open near you. It works by simply clicking the heart button to add it to the favorites or by clicking the x to pass and move on to the next. Once you go through and heart what you like you can click the favorites tab at the top and it will take you to a page that displays all your favorited items. From there you can click on what restaurant you want to check out and it will take you to the details page that displays the address, phone number, star rating, and even how many people like this restaurant.
